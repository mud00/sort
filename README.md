# sort
Sorting Algorithms in C (with their Complexity)

The algorithms in the code:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort

- Fusion Sort
- Quicksort

The program calculates the time every sort takes (its complexity) and returns it in the console. Please give the program at least 40 seconds to complete the sorts.
